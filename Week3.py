## While Loops


#Fill in the blanks to make the print_prime_factors function print all the prime factors of a number. A prime factor is a number that is prime and divides another without a remainder.
def print_prime_factors(number):
  # Start with two, which is the first prime
  factor = 2
  # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
  while factor <= number:
    # Check if factor is a divisor of number
    if number % factor == 0:
      # If it is, print it and divide the original number
      print(factor)
      number = number / factor
    else:
      # If it's not, increment the factor by one
      factor += 1
  return "Done"

# The following code can lead to an infinite loop. Fix the code so that it can finish successfully for all numbers.

print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True

# Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder.

# The multiplication_table function prints the results of a number passed to it multiplied by 1 through 5. An additional requirement is that the result is not to exceed 25, which is done with the break statement. Fill in the blanks to complete the function to satisfy these conditions.

## For Loops

# Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1,n):
        result *= x
    return result

for n in range(0,10):
    print(n, factorial(n+1))


# Write a script that prints the first 10 cube numbers (x**3), starting with x=1 and ending with x=10.
for x in range(1, 11):
  print(x**3)


# Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.
number = 0
multiplier = 7
while number <= 100:
    print(number)
    number += multiplier


## Recursion

# Fill in the blanks to make the is_power_of function return whether the number is a power of the given base. Note: base is assumed to be a positive number. Tip: for functions that return a boolean value, you can return the result of a comparison.
def is_power_of(number, base):
  # Base case: when number is smaller than base.
  if number < base:
    # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
    return number == 1

  # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
  return is_power_of(number//base, base)

print(is_power_of(8,2)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of(64,4)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of(70,10)) # Should be False


# Implement the sum_positive_numbers function, as a recursive function that returns the sum of all positive numbers between the number n received and 1. For example, when n is 3 it should return 1+2+3=6, and when n is 5 it should return 1+2+3+4+5=15.
def sum_positive_numbers(n):
    if n == 0:
        return n
    return n + sum_positive_numbers(n-1)

print(sum_positive_numbers(3)) # Should be 6

## Module Graded Assessment

def show_letters(word):
	for x in word:
		print(x)

show_letters("Hello")
# Should print one line per letter


# Complete the function digits(n) that returns how many digits the number has. For example: 25 has 2 digits and 144 has 3 digits. Tip: you can figure out the digits of a number by dividing it by 10 once per digit until there are no digits left.
def digits(n):
     count = 0
     if n == 0:
         return 1
     while (n >= 1):

print(digits(0))    # Should print 1


# This function prints out a multiplication table (where each number is the result of multiplying the first number of its row by the number at the top of its column). Fill in the blanks so that calling multiplication_table(1, 3) will print out:

        ## 2 4 6 
        ## 3 6 9

print(counter(5, 5)) # Should be "Counting up: 5"


# The even_numbers function returns a space-separated string of all positive numbers that are divisible by 2, up to and including the maximum that's passed into the function. For example, even_numbers(6) returns ???2 4 6???. Fill in the blank to make this work.
