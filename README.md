5. **If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size ?**

**Ans-**
```python
      def calculate_storage(filesize):
          block_size = 4096
          # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
          full_blocks = filesize // block_size
          # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
          partial_block_remainder = filesize % block_size
          # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
          # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
          # to store your data.
          if partial_block_remainder > 0:
            return 4096 * (full_blocks + 1)
          return 4096

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
```
## **Module 2 Graded Assessment**

	      elif color == "green":
		      hex_color = "#00ff00"
	      elif color == "blue":
		      hex_color = "#0000ff"
	      else:
		      hex_color = "unknown"
	      return hex_color

print(color_translator("blue")) # Should be #0000ff
print(color_translator("yellow")) # Should be unknown
print(color_translator("red")) # Should be #ff0000

**Ans-**
```python
      def exam_grade(score):
	      if score > 95:
		      grade = "Top Score"
	      elif score >= 60:
		      grade = "Pass"
	      else:
		      grade = "Fail"
	      return grade

print(exam_grade(65)) # Should be Pass
print(exam_grade(55)) # Should be Fail
print(exam_grade(60)) # Should be Pass
print(exam_grade(95)) # Should be Pass
print(exam_grade(100)) # Should be Top Score

      **Specifically:**

      **If both the** ***last_name*** **and the** ***first_name*** **parameters are supplied, the function should return like so:**

**Ans-**
```python
      def format_name(first_name, last_name):
      	# code goes here
      	string = ("Name: " + last_name + ", " + first_name)
      	if first_name == "":
      		return("Name: " + last_name)
      	elif last_name == "":
      		return ("Name: " + first_name)
      	else:
      		return string 

print(format_name("Ernest", "Hemingway"))
# Should return the string "Name: Hemingway, Ernest"

print(format_name("", "Madonna"))
# Should return the string "Name: Madonna"

print(format_name("Voltaire", ""))
# Should return the string "Name: Voltaire"
```

```
10. **The fractional_part function divides the numerator by the denominator, and returns just the fractional part (a number between 0** **and 1). Complete the body of the function so that it returns the right number.**
**Note: Since division by 0 produces an error, if the denominator is 0, the function should return 0 instead of attempting the division.**

**Ans-**
```python
      def format_name(first_name, last_name):
      	# code goes here
      	string = 'Name: ' + ', '.join([name for name in [last_name, first_name] if name]) if any([last_name, first_name]) else ''

        # Start with two, which is the first prime
        factor = 2
        # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
        while factor <= number:
          # Check if factor is a divisor of number
          if number % factor == 0:
            # If it is, print it and divide the original number
            print(factor)
            number = number / factor
          else:
            # If it's not, increment the factor by one
            factor += 1
        return "Done"

print_prime_factors(100)
# Should print 2,2,5,5
# DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
```
3. **The following code can lead to an infinite loop. Fix the code so that it can finish successfully for all numbers.** <br>
**Note: Try running your function with the number 0 as the input, and see what you get!**

**Ans-**
```python
      def is_power_of_two(n):
        # Check if the number can be divided by two without a remainder
        while n % 2 == 0 and n!= 0:
          n = n / 2
        # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two
         if n == 1:
          return True
          n += 1
        return False
  

print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(9)) # Should be False
```
4. **Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder.**

**Ans-**
```python
      def sum_divisors(n):
        x = 1
        sum = 0
        # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
        while x < n:
          if n % x == 0:
            sum += x
            x += 1
          else:
            x += 1
        return sum

print(sum_divisors(0))
# 0
print(sum_divisors(3)) # Should sum of 1
# 1
print(sum_divisors(36)) # Should sum of 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18
# 55
print(sum_divisors(102)) # Should be sum of 2+3+6+17+34+51
# 114
```
5. **The multiplication_table function prints the results of a number passed to it multiplied by 1 through 5. An additional requirement is that the result is not to exceed 25, which is done with the break statement. Fill in the blanks to complete the function to satisfy these conditions.**

**Ans-**
```python
      def multiplication_table(number):
      	# Initialize the starting point of the multiplication table
      	multiplier = 1
      	# Only want to loop through 5
      	while multiplier <= 5:
      		result = multiplier * number
      		# What is the additional condition to exit out of the loop?
      		if result > 25:
      			break
      		print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))
      		# Increment the variable for the loop
      		multiplier += 1

multiplication_table(3) 
# Should print: 3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9 3x4=12 3x5=15

multiplication_table(5) 
# Should print: 5x1=5 5x2=10 5x3=15 5x4=20 5x5=25

# **Recursion**

1. **What is recursion used for ?**

**Ans-**
```
      Recursion lets us tackle complex problems by reducing the problem to a simpler one.
```
2. **Which of these activities are good use cases for recursive programs? Check all that apply.**

**Ans-**
```
      Going through a file system collecting information related to directories and files.

      Managing permissions assigned to groups inside a company, when each group can contain both subgroups and users.
```
3. **Fill in the blanks to make the is_power_of function return whether the number is a power of the given base. Note: base is assumed to be a positive number. Tip: for functions that return a boolean value, you can return the result of a comparison.**

**Ans-**
```python
      def is_power_of(number, base):
        # Base case: when number is smaller than base.
        if number < base:
          # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
          return number == 1

        # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
        return is_power_of(number//base, base)

print(is_power_of(8,2)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of(64,4)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of(70,10)) # Should be False
```
4. **The count_users function recursively counts the amount of users that belong to a group in the company system, by going through each of the members of a group and if one of them is a group, recursively calling the function and counting the members. But it has a bug! Can you spot the problem and fix it ?**

**Ans-**
```python
      def count_users(group):
        count = 0
        for member in get_members(group):
          if is_group(member):
            count += count_users(member)
          else:
            count += 1
        return count

print(count_users("sales")) # Should be 3
print(count_users("engineering")) # Should be 8
print(count_users("everyone")) # Should be 18
```
5. **Implement the sum_positive_numbers function, as a recursive function that returns the sum of all positive numbers between the number n received and 1. For example, when n is 3 it should return 1+2+3=6, and when n is 5 it should return 1+2+3+4+5=15.**

**Ans-**
```python
      def sum_positive_numbers(n):
        if n == 0:
          return n

# **Week 4 :- Strings, Lists & Dictionaries**
## **Strings**

1. **The is_palindrome function checks if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that can be equally read from left to right or right to left, omitting blank spaces, and ignoring capitalization. Examples of palindromes are words like kayak and radar, and phrases like "Never Odd or Even". Fill in the blanks in this function to return True if the passed string is a palindrome, False if not.**

**Ans-**
```python
      def is_palindrome(input_string):
	# We'll create two strings, to compare them
	new_string = ""
	reverse_string = ""
	# Traverse through each letter of the input string
	for letter in input_string.lower():
		# Add any non-blank letters to the 
		# end of one string, and to the front
		# of the other string. 
		if letter.isalpha():
			new_string = new_string + letter
			reverse_string = letter + reverse_string
	# Compare the strings
	if new_string == reverse_string:
		return True
	return False

print(is_palindrome("Never Odd or Even")) # Should be True
print(is_palindrome("abc")) # Should be False
print(is_palindrome("kayak")) # Should be True
```
2. **Using the format method, fill in the gaps in the convert_distance function so that it returns the phrase "X miles equals Y km", with Y having only 1 decimal place. For example, convert_distance(12) should return "12 miles equals 19.2 km".**

**Ans-**
```python
      def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6 
	result = "{} miles equals {:.1f} km".format(miles, km)
	return result

print(convert_distance(12)) # Should be: 12 miles equals 19.2 km
print(convert_distance(5.5)) # Should be: 5.5 miles equals 8.8 km
print(convert_distance(11)) # Should be: 11 miles equals 17.6 km
```
3. **If we have a string variable named Weather = "Rainfall", which of the following will print the substring or all characters before the "f" ?**

**Ans-**
```
print(Weather[:4])
```
4. **Fill in the gaps in the nametag function so that it uses the format method to return first_name and the first initial of last_name followed by a period. For example, nametag("Jane", "Smith") should return "Jane S."**

**Ans-**
```python
def nametag(first_name, last_name):
	return("{} {}.".format(first_name, last_name[0]))

print(nametag("Jane", "Smith")) 
# Should display "Jane S." 
print(nametag("Francesco", "Rinaldi")) 
# Should display "Francesco R." 
print(nametag("Jean-Luc", "Grand-Pierre")) 
# Should display "Jean-Luc G." 
```
5. **The replace_ending function replaces the old string in a sentence with the new string, but only if the sentence ends with the old string. If there is more than one occurrence of the old string in the sentence, only the one at the end is replaced, not all of them. For example, replace_ending("abcabc", "abc", "xyz") should return abcxyz, not xyzxyz or xyzabc. The string comparison is case-sensitive, so replace_ending("abcabc", "ABC", "xyz") should return abcabc (no changes made).**

**Ans-**
```python
def replace_ending(sentence, old, new):
	# Check if the old string is at the end of the sentence 
	if sentence.endswith(old):
		# Using i as the slicing index, combine the part
		# of the sentence up to the matched string at the 
		# end with the new string
		i = len(old)
		new_sentence = sentence[:-i] + new
		return new_sentence

	# Return the original sentence if there is no match 
	return sentence
	
print(replace_ending("It's raining cats and cats", "cats", "dogs")) 
# Should display "It's raining cats and dogs"
print(replace_ending("She sells seashells by the seashore", "seashells", "donuts")) 
# Should display "She sells seashells by the seashore"
print(replace_ending("The weather is nice in May", "may", "april")) 
# Should display "The weather is nice in May"
print(replace_ending("The weather is nice in May", "May", "April")) 
# Should display "The weather is nice in April"
```
## **Lists**

1. **Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods you’ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.**

**Ans-**
```python
filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
newfilenames = [file.replace(".hpp", ".h") for file in filenames]  

print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
```
2. **Let's create a function that turns text into pig latin: a simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. For example, python ends up as ythonpay.**

**Ans-**
```python
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  # Separate the text into words
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    # Create the pig latin word and add it to the list
    piglatinword = word[1:] + word[0] + "ay"
    say += " " + piglatinword
    # Turn the list back into a phrase
  return say
		
print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```
3. **The permissions of a file in a Linux system are split into three sets of three permissions: read, write, and execute for the owner, group, and others. Each of the three values can be expressed as an octal number summing each permission, with 4 corresponding to read, 2 to write, and 1 to execute. Or it can be written with a string using the letters r, w, and x or - when the permission is not granted.**
**For example:**
**640 is read/write for the owner, read for the group, and no permissions for the others; converted to a string, it would be:** **"rw-r-----"**
**755 is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for group and others; converted to a string, it would be: "rwxr-xr-x".Fill in the blanks to make the code convert a permission in octal format into a string format.**

**Ans-**
```python
def octal_to_string(octal):
    result = ""
    value_letters = [(4,"r"),(2,"w"),(1,"x")]
    # Iterate over each of the digits in octal
    for digit in [int(n) for n in str(octal)]:
        # Check for each of the permissions values
        for value, letter in value_letters:
            if digit >= value:
                result += letter
                digit -= value
            else:
                result += "-"
    return result
    
print(octal_to_string(755)) # Should be rwxr-xr-x
print(octal_to_string(644)) # Should be rw-r--r--
print(octal_to_string(750)) # Should be rwxr-x---
print(octal_to_string(600)) # Should be rw-------
```
4. **Tuples and lists are very similar types of sequences. What is the main thing that makes a tuple different from a list ?**

**Ans-**
```
A tuple is immutable
```
5. **The group_list function accepts a group name and a list of members, and returns a string with the format: group_name: member1, member2, … For example, group_list("g", ["a","b","c"]) returns "g: a, b, c". Fill in the gaps in this function to do that.**

**Ans-**
```python
def group_list(group, users):
  members = ",".join(users)
  return "{}:{}".format(group, " " + members)

print(group_list("Marketing", ["Mike", "Karen", "Jake", "Tasha"])) # Should be "Marketing: Mike, Karen, Jake, Tasha"
print(group_list("Engineering", ["Kim", "Jay", "Tom"])) # Should be "Engineering: Kim, Jay, Tom"
print(group_list("Users", "")) # Should be "Users:"
```
6. **The guest_list function reads in a list of tuples with the name, age, and profession of each party guest, and prints the sentence "Guest is X years old and works as __." for each one. For example, guest_list(('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")) should print out: Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef. Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer. Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer. Fill in the gaps in this function to do that.**

**Ans-**
```python
def guest_list(guests):
	for person in guests:
		name, age, profession = person
		print("{} is {} years old and works as {}".format(name, age, profession))

guest_list([('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")])

#Click Run to submit code
"""

Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef
Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer
Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer
"""
```
## **Dictionaries**

	user_groups = {}
	# Go through group_dictionary
	for group, users in group_dictionary.items():
		# Now go through the users in the group
		for user in users:
			# Now add the group to the the list of
            # groups for this user, creating the entry
            # in the dictionary if necessary
			user_groups[user] = user_groups.get(user,[]) + [group]

	return(user_groups)

print(groups_per_user({"local": ["admin", "userA"],

```

## **Module 4 Graded Assessment**
<br>

1. **The format_address function separates out parts of the address string into new strings: house_number and street_name, and returns: "house number X on street named Y". The format of the input string is: numeric house number, followed by the street name which may contain numbers, but never by themselves, and could be several words long. For example, "123 Main Street", "1001 1st Ave", or "55 North Center Drive". Fill in the gaps to complete this function.**

**Ans-**
```python
def format_address(address_string):
  # Declare variables
  house_number = ""
  street_name = ""
  # Separate the address string into parts
  address_string = address_string.split()

  # Traverse through the address parts
  for string in address_string:
    # Determine if the address part is the
    # house number or part of the street name
    if string.isdigit():

print(combine_guests(Rorys_guests, Taylors_guests))
```
7. **Use a dictionary to count the frequency of letters in the input string. Only letters should be counted, not blank spaces, numbers, or punctuation. Upper case should be considered the same as lower case. For example, count_letters("This is a sentence.") should return {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 3, 'a': 1, 'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'c': 1}**

**Ans-**
```python
def count_letters(text):

# **Week 5 :- Object Oriented Programming**
## **Object Oriented Programming**
1. **Let’s test your knowledge of using dot notation to access methods and attributes in an object. Let’s say we have a class called Birds. Birds has two attributes: color and number. Birds also has a method called count() that counts the number of birds (adds a value to number). Which of the following lines of code will correctly print the number of birds? Keep in mind, the number of birds is 0 until they are counted!**

**Ans-**
```python
bluejay.count()

print(bluejay.number)
```
2. **Creating new instances of class objects can be a great way to keep track of values using attributes associated with the object. The values of these attributes can be easily changed at the object level.  The following code illustrates a famous quote by George Bernard Shaw, using objects to represent people. Fill in the blanks to make the code satisfy the behavior described in the quote.**

**Ans-**
```python
# “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then
# you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have
# an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”
# George Bernard Shaw

class Person:
    apples = 0
    ideas = 0

johanna = Person()
johanna.apples = 1
johanna.ideas = 1

martin = Person()
martin.apples = 2
martin.ideas = 1

def exchange_apples(you, me):
#Here, despite G.B. Shaw's quote, our characters have started with       #different amounts of apples so we can better observe the results. 
#We're going to have Martin and Johanna exchange ALL their apples with #one another.
#Hint: how would you switch values of variables, 
#so that "you" and "me" will exchange ALL their apples with one another?
#Do you need a temporary variable to store one of the values?
#You may need more than one line of code to do that, which is OK. 
    x=0
    x=you.apples
    you.apples=me.apples
    me.apples=x
    return you.apples, me.apples
    
def exchange_ideas(you, me):
    #"you" and "me" will share our ideas with one another.
    #What operations need to be performed, so that each object receives
    #the shared number of ideas?
    #Hint: how would you assign the total number of ideas to 
    #each idea attribute? Do you need a temporary variable to store 
    #the sum of ideas, or can you find another way? 
    #Use as many lines of code as you need here.
    x=0
    x=you.ideas
    you.ideas += me.ideas
    me.ideas += x
    return you.ideas, me.ideas

exchange_apples(johanna, martin)
print("Johanna has {} apples and Martin has {} apples".format(johanna.apples, martin.apples))
exchange_ideas(johanna, martin)
print("Johanna has {} ideas and Martin has {} ideas".format(johanna.ideas, martin.ideas))
```
3. **The City class has the following attributes: name, country (where the city is located), elevation (measured in meters), and population (approximate, according to recent statistics). Fill in the blanks of the max_elevation_city function to return the name of the city and its country (separated by a comma), when comparing the 3 defined instances for a specified minimal population. For example, calling the function for a minimum population of 1 million: max_elevation_city(1000000) should return "Sofia, Bulgaria".**

**Ans-**
```python
# define a basic city class
class City:
	name = ""
	country = ""
	elevation = 0 
	population = 0

# create a new instance of the City class and
# define each attribute
city1 = City()
city1.name = "Cusco"
city1.country = "Peru"
city1.elevation = 3399
city1.population = 358052

# create a new instance of the City class and
# define each attribute
city2 = City()
city2.name = "Sofia"
city2.country = "Bulgaria"
city2.elevation = 2290
city2.population = 1241675

# create a new instance of the City class and
# define each attribute
city3 = City()
city3.name = "Seoul"
city3.country = "South Korea"
city3.elevation = 38
city3.population = 9733509

def max_elevation_city(min_population):
	# Initialize the variable that will hold 
# the information of the city with 
# the highest elevation 
	return_city = City()

	# Evaluate the 1st instance to meet the requirements:
	# does city #1 have at least min_population and
	# is its elevation the highest evaluated so far?
	if city1.population >= min_population and city1.elevation > return_city.elevation:
         return_city = city1
	# Evaluate the 2nd instance to meet the requirements:
	# does city #2 have at least min_population and
	# is its elevation the highest evaluated so far?
	if city2.population >= min_population and city2.elevation >return_city.elevation:
         return_city = city2
	# Evaluate the 3rd instance to meet the requirements:
	# does city #3 have at least min_population and
	# is its elevation the highest evaluated so far?
	if city3.population >= min_population and city3.elevation > return_city.elevation:
		return_city = city3

	#Format the return string
	if return_city.name:
		return "{}, {}".format(return_city.name, return_city.country)
	else:
		return ""

print(max_elevation_city(100000)) # Should print "Cusco, Peru"
print(max_elevation_city(1000000)) # Should print "Sofia, Bulgaria"
print(max_elevation_city(10000000)) # Should print ""
```
4. **What makes an object different from a class ?**

**Ans-**
```
An object is a specific instance of a class
```
5. **We have two pieces of furniture: a brown wood table and a red leather couch. Fill in the blanks following the creation of each Furniture class instance, so that the describe_furniture function can format a sentence that describes these pieces as follows: "This piece of furniture is made of {color} {material}"**

**Ans-**
```python
class Furniture:
	color = ""
	material = ""

table = Furniture()
table.color = "brown"
table.material = "wood"

couch = Furniture()
couch.color = "red"
couch.material = "leather"

def describe_furniture(piece):
	return ("This piece of furniture is made of {} {}".format(piece.color, piece.material))

print(describe_furniture(table)) 
# Should be "This piece of furniture is made of brown wood"
print(describe_furniture(couch)) 
# Should be "This piece of furniture is made of red leather"
```
